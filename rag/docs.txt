Hidan AI is a web-based AI chatbot application developed using Python and the Flask framework.

The purpose of Hidan AI is to allow users to register, log in, and interact with an intelligent AI assistant through a web interface.

The project uses OpenAI API to generate AI responses for user questions.

Users can ask questions through a chat interface, and the AI responds in real time.

User authentication is implemented using a username and password system.

All registered user details such as fullname, email, username, and mobile number are stored in an SQLite database.

Chat history is saved in the database so that previous conversations can be retrieved later.

The backend of the application is built using Flask, which handles routing, session management, and API requests.

The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for responsive design.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented in this project to improve answer accuracy.

RAG works by searching related information from stored documents before generating an AI response.

Sentence Transformers are used to convert text into numerical vectors that represent the meaning of sentences.

FAISS is used to store and search these vectors efficiently based on similarity.

This project demonstrates how AI, backend development, databases, and document-based intelligence work together in a real-world application.

Hidan AI can be used as a learning project, AI assistant, customer support bot, or portfolio project.
Hidan AI  create and deployement on cloud in Oct-11-2025
